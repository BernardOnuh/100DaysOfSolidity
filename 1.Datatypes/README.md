# There are two types of Data in Solidity 
* 1-Value Types Solidity 
* 2-Reference Types Solidity

# ⭐ Value Types Solidity 
 Value-type data stores information directly in memory. The Variable are then associated with this value types allow duplication in assignment  or functions.


# ⭐ Reference Types Solidity

Reference type values don’t directly store values – but rather store them by referring to the address of the data’s location, without sharing it directly. The location of the data plays an important role in the amount of gas used in each transaction. Not optimizing data locations properly negatively impacts the performance of smart contracts. 

Solidity uses reference types in a unique manner – each reference variable points the users towards the location of a value data type.

# Types  of  Value Types Solidity

* 1.Addresses
* 2.Enum
* 3.Boolean.
* 4.Signed integers
* 5.Unsigned integers
* 6.Byte

# Types of Reference Types Solidity
* 1.Arrays
* 2.Array Members
* 3.Byte Arrays
* 4.String Arrays
* 5.Structs
* 6.Mapping
