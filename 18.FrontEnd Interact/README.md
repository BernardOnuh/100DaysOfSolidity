## INTEGRATE SOLIDITY CONTRACT WITH A FRONT-END APPLICATION

Integrating your Solidity Contract with a Front-End Application is now as easy as **ABC**,

It all Started with [Ether JS](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/) now we have more advanced and efficient ways to connect Solidity Contract to Front-End application.

## What is Ethers?
The ethers.js library aims to be a complete and compact library for interacting with the Ethereum Blockchain and its ecosystem. It was originally designed for use with ethers.io and has since expanded into a more general-purpose library.

Read more on Ether Js [here](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/).

## There are other ways to connect your Smart Contract with the Front-End :
- [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/)
wagmi is a collection of React Hooks containing everything you need to start working with Ethereum. wagmi makes it easy to "Connect Wallet," display ENS and balance information, sign messages, interact with contracts, and much more â€” all with caching, request deduplication, and persistence.
